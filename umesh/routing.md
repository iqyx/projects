Ad Hoc Mobile Wireless Networks Routing Protocols – A Review
------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract: Mobile ad hoc networks(MANET) represent complex distributed systems that comprise
wireless mobile nodes that can freely and dynamically self organize into arbitrary and temporary ad-
hoc network topologies, allowing people and devices to seamlessly internet work in areas with no
preexisting communication infrastructure e.g., disaster recovery environments. An ad-hoc network is
not a new one, having been around in various forms for over 20 years. Traditionally, tactical networks
have been the only communication networking application that followed the ad-hoc paradigm.
Recently the introduction of new technologies such as Bluetooth, IEEE 802.11 and hyperlan are
helping enable eventual commercial MANET deployments outside the military domain. These recent
revolutions have been generating a renewed and growing interest in the research and development of
MANET. To facilitate communication within the network a routing protocol is used to discover routes
between nodes. The goal of the routing protocol is to have an efficient route establishment between a
pair of nodes, so that messages can be delivered in a timely manner. Bandwidth and power constraints
are the important factors to be considered in current wireless network because multi-hop ad-hoc
wireless relies on each node in the network to act as a router and packet forwarder. This dependency
places bandwidth, power computation demands on mobile host to be taken into account while choosing
the protocol. Routing protocols used in wired network cannot be used for mobile ad-hoc networks
because of node mobility. The ad-hoc routing protocols are divided into two classes: table driven and
demand based. This paper reviews and discusses routing protocol belonging to each category.

PROBABILISTIC ROUTING USING QUEUING THEORY FOR MANETs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Abstract
Mobile ad-hoc networks pose real difficulty in finding the multihop shortest paths because of continuous
changing positions of the nodes. Traditional ad-hoc routing protocols are proposed to find multi-hop
routes based on shortest path routing algorithms, which cannot effectively adapt to time-varying radio
links and network topologies of Ad-hoc networks. In this paper we proposed an enhanced routing
algorithm, which uses probabilistic approach for the stability of the neighboring nodes in finding and
maintaining the routing paths in Ad-hoc networks. The probability of a node being stable in the path is
modeled by queuing theory, where the stability of a node is measured by number of packets arrived at a
node and the number of packets being serviced by the node per unit time. Proposed approach shows
significant improvement over the traditional Ad-hoc on-demand distance vector routing protocol as
analyzed in the result analysis section.

Probability Routing Algorithm for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks’ Resources Management
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract—This paper introduces a resource management appli-
cation of a probabilistic-based ant routing algorithm for mobile ad
hoc networks (ARAMA) that is inspired from the ant’s life [1]–[5].
Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) are highly dynamic, self-con-
figured and self-built networks. The goal of this paper is to present
ARAMA ability to manage MANET’s resources by achieving fair
network resources distribution, while considering the dynamic
characteristics of MANETs and the need for low control over-
heads. This paper provides a description for the algorithm. In this
algorithm, the nodes’ (node’s energy, processing power, . . . ) and
links’ (bandwidth, . . . ) parameters are measured and collected
in the nodes’ indices. A path index is used to measure the path
total resources and serves to minimize the forward control packet
(ant) size. The concepts of negative backward ant destination
trail are introduced to enhance the performance of the algorithm.
The simulation results show the potential of ARAMA to achieve
fair energy usage across the network nodes as an example of the
network resource management. More, the results show the general
ability of the algorithm to solve MANET’s routing problem.

MANET Routing Protocols Based on Ant Colony Optimization
----------------------------------------------------------------

Abstract — Apart from tremendous research being done all
around the globe, still ad hoc networks are a big challenge for
the researchers. Routing in an ad hoc network is extremely
challenging because of its dynamic nature, limited bandwidth
and power energy. Somehow, Swarm Intelligence based
techniques such as ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithms
have shown to be a good technique for developing routing
algorithms for ad hoc networks. ACO based routing is an
efficient routing scheme based on the behaviour of foraging
ants. The collective behaviour of ants helps to find the shortest
path from the nest to a food source, by deposition of a chemical
substance called pheromone on the visited nodes. This
mechanism from collective intelligence is applied to the ad hoc
network by researchers. In this paper, we have brought some
characteristics as well as performance analysis of the proposed
ACO based ad hoc routing protocols and compare them with
the well-known ad hoc routing protocols. The results presented
in the last also help the researchers to understand the
differences among various ACO based routing algorithms and
to choose appropriate protocol for their research work. Our
study shows how this approach has significantly improved the
performance of the ad hoc networks.
