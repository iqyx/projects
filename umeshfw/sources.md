All internal components of uMesh node firmware (including the uMesh network protocol stack) are maintained on Github [TODO link here]().



Version changelog:
---------------------------

### 0.3.0

Waiting to be published on Github. ETA 01/2015.



### 0.2.x versions

Development moved to non-public Git repository on 2014-10-09.. 

  * qNode5 port changes. Fatfs and qdl library added (external dependencies)
  * RFM69 driver modifications, RSSI sampling support
  * basic CLI implementation using TreeCli and LineEdit library
  * basic HAL implementation
  * HAL power class
  * HAL LED class
  * modified power statistics information gathering (HAL solar driver, HAL rechargeable driver)
  * CLI /system subtree (process and memory statistics)


### pre-0.2.0 versions

Version control was done using SVN repository. The whole prototype codebase was rewritten
and new project structure was established. All major development was done between 2014-01-15
and 2014-08-28 - slightly slower due to lack of free time. Random versions from this period
were used to test qNode4 and qNode5 nodes and RFM69 radios. qNode2 hardware using STM32L151
and Spirit1 transceiver was never tested. See [platforms](platforms) for more info about various
hardware ports.



### pre-0.1.0 versions

This first prototype was maintained from 2014-01-01 to 2014-01-15 without any versioning control. History is unknown.
